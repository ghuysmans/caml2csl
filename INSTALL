Requirements:
=============

The following commands must be installed on your workstation:
 - Caml-Light, version 0.7
 - Objective-Caml, version 1.03 at least
 - the C preprocessor cpp
 


Installation procedure:
=======================

1) Edit file config to set the following variables to the right paths:

      - CPP is the command to invoke the C preprocessor (check if the path
        is correct),

      - MANDIR is the directory where the manpages will be installed (in
	fact, the manpage will be copied in MANDIR/man1)

      - the script of the commands caml2csl and renamer will be installed in
        BINDIR (will be created if it does not exist),

      - the conversion files will be stored in INSTALLDIR (will be created if
        it does not exist),

      - LIBNAME is the name of the core conversion file. Change it only if
        that file already exists.


2) From caml2cslV2.0/ directory, do:

        make world

   A message tells you when the installation is done. This means that the
   commands caml2csl, renamer and the conversion files are installed in
   their directories.


3) You can install the commands and the manpage with:

        make install

        make install-manpage


4) You can test caml2csl on 2 examples: go in test/coc/ or test/toto, and type:

  make

   This should start the translation and the compilation of the examples.

   coc is a small program written in Caml-Light that will be translated
   without human help.

   toto.caml is a kind of bench to show what caml2csl can translate and what
   it cannot. The translation of toto.caml will yield a few warnings, and will
   fail to compile.



If anything goes wrong:
=======================

1) Make sure that camlc, camllibr, camlyacc, camllex, cslc and cpp are
   properly installed, using the command which:

  which camlc
  ...
  which cpp 

If one of these commands fails, you must install the corresponding command.


2) You must have the rights to create or write in the directories indicated
   by the variables BINDIR and INSTALLDIR of config.


If compilation failed, you can restart from the beginning by doing:

  make clean

to remove all the files generated during compilation, and then

  make world

to restart compilation.
